# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
  
### Purpose
  The purpose of this assignment was to compare the data between 'urban', 'suburban', and 'rural' city types and the total drivers, total fares, and total rides by that type. We were also tasked with creating a line graph that showed the total fares by city type over a five month period.

## PyBer Analysis Results

  Above is the final data frame created from the city and ride data provided. As shown, the total amounts for all three areas were the highest in urban cities, while suburban cities were the the middle of all totals and the rural cities were the lowest in terms of totals. The average fares actually showed the inverse, however with the rural cities having higher fares on average for rides and drivers, and the urban cities had the lowest fares on average for the rides and drivers.
  
  The below graph was created to show the differences in fares by city type for each of the three types looked at. As shown in the data frame above, the urban city types had the highest total fares while the rural had the lowest with suburban in the middle.

## PyBer Analysis Summary
  Based on the results above, the urban city types seems to be a relatively saturated market with by far the most rides and drivers in any city type. There is potential profit to be made there either way due to the cheaper fares on average than suburban and urban city types. Rural city types seem to be too expensive with the fares far higher than other city types. Putting more rides in the suburbs would be a decent idea as well since they have less than half of the amount of rides in urban cities.
